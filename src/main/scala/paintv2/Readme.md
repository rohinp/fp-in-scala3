This is the most simplest form of command line based paint applicatin implemented in scala3.

<p>Major highlights for feature to look for in the code are.

In this version of paint we have
>1. Context functions

check version 1 of paint for below features
>1. Type class in scala3
>1. Extention methods
>1. ADT using Enum
>1. @main annotaiton

### This one is a fairly simple implementation, and the other versions of the paint might demonstrate other features of scala3
