# Paint app

This is the most simplest form of command line based paint applicatin implemented in scala3.

<p>Major highlights for feature to look for in the code are.
<ul>
    <li>Type class in scala3</li>
    <li>Extention methods</li>
    <li>ADT using Enum</li>
    <li>@main annotaiton</li>
</ul>

### This one is a fairly simple implementation, and the other versions of the paint might demonstrate other features of scala3
